# RocGPT

Small cli chatbot app written in [Roc](https://roc-lang.org) just for fun! This project gave me an oportunity to get more familiar with Tasks and Task chaining in Roc, in particular using Task.loop, as well as interacting with an online API using the basic-cli platform, and Luke Boswell's roc-json package.

> This project is the predecessor to the [roc-openrouter](https://github.com/imclerran/roc-openrouter) library.
